# A Star Wars movie search UI

A react application that uses https://swapi.dev/ to display Star Wars movies data.


## How it works
Go to https://vigilant-lichterman-be0b05.netlify.app and search for a movie. Once a movie is found you can click on the search resuts and the app will redirect you to the movie page. Clicked on the wrong link? No problem, you can hit the back button from your browser or the one inside the app above the movie details.
